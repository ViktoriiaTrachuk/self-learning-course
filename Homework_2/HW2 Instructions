Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp 

Python methods could take optional arguments:

Homework:
Implement the following methods:
bubble_sort - should take a list of numbers as an argument and return the new list with elements sorted in ascending order. Also should take an optional boolean argument to change the sorting order from ascending to descending.
If a list contains non-numeric value, method should raise ValueError
maximum - should take a list of numbers as an argument and return the biggest element. If empty list is given or if list contains non-numeric value, method should raise ValueError
minimum - should take a list of numbers as an argument and return the biggest element. If empty list is given or if list contains non-numeric value, method should raise ValueError
Implement pytest test cases for each three methods:
Define common input data for all three method tests:
Unsorted integer array
Unsorted mixed integer/float array
Pre-sorted array
Empty array
Array with mixed numeric and nonnumeric values
Use predefined data to implement parameterized test cases
The usual: Makefile with setup/test/clean targets to create venv, run tests with reports, cleaning the stuff etc.
